This repo contains the game for ENG100D's Spring 2025 Group B team. Group B is tasked with making an environmentally-focused game to inspire and learn climate actions for the intended younger audience, connecting global environmental challenges to local, relatable, and digestible issues that have personal relevance to the player.  


The repo right now has version 3 of the game, which contains the full original game design planned.
