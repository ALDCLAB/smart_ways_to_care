This repo contains the game for ENG100D's Spring 2025 Group B team. Group B is tasked with making an environmentally-focused game to inspire and learn climate actions for the intended younger audience, connecting global environmental challenges to local, relatable, and digestible issues that have personal relevance to the player.  


The repo right now has the second basic draft version of the game. 

**Things we need to add:**
- Add touch controls for tablet use. (Some touch controls are implemented but not fully to play the entire game.)
- Sound effects and feedback to certain actions of the game, as well as background music. The current build of the game has no sound. 
- Implementing help button, for more information of what should be in each bin. 

Things we would like to add but are a bit less necessary (future roadmap):
- Smooth transitions between each screens.
- Confirmation button to go to main menu during play screen to avoid accidentally going to the main menu.
- Game remembers your current progress of the game. 
- Clouds and other moving objects not resetting to their original positions when switching screens.
