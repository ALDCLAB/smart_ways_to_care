This repo contains the game for ENG100D's Spring 2025 Group B team. Group B is tasked with making an environmentally-focused game to inspire and learn climate actions for the intended younger audience. 


The repo right now has the first basic draft version of the game. This current version contains several bugs, such as visual feedback issues and some visual features bugging out when clicking on several screens. There is also no help tab, and there is no further levels other than the first one. 

Things we want and need to add:
- Fix the current bugs within the game.
- Add touch controls for tablet use.
- Sound effects and feedback to certain actions of the game, as well as background music. The current build of the game has no sound. 
- Implementing help button, for more information of what should be in each bin. 

Things we would like to add but are a bit more complicated and not that needed in this current state of the game:
- Smooth transitions between each screens.
- Confirmation button to go to main menu during play screen to avoid accidentally going to the main menu.
- Seal describes on why the object was put in the correct bin or incorrect bin.
- Game remembers your current progress of the game. 
- Clouds and other moving objects not resetting to their original positions when switching screens.
